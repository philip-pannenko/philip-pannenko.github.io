I recently started a new job and I received a new new work laptop. Thankfully we have a bit of flexibility with which software we can use. Nothing bothers me more than having to use Adobe Reader, WinZip, etc... That software has become really bloated, laggy and just frustrates me.

This is more for me than anyone else incase I need to reference this again in the future, but here's my preferred list of software in no particular order. 

Software
* Notepad++
* Eclipse
* Chrome
* Dropbox
* Digsby
* Virtual Clone Drive
* FileHippo UpdateChecker
* Steam
* Foxit Reader
* Skype
* WinSCP
* WinMerge
* 7-Zip
* CCleaner
* Paint.NET
* TortoiseSVN

Chrome Plugins
* LastPass
* Xmarks Bookmarks Synchronizer

Eclipse Plugins
* CDT
* EGit
* Juno Optimizations
* m2e
* Hibernate Tools
* Subclipse
* Vaadin
