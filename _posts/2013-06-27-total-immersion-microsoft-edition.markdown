I've been mulling over doing this for a while and I think it's time to try it out: I'm going to use all(*) Microsoft products. I'm talking phone, game console, PC, tablet, laptop, etc... But it doesn't stop there, I'm going software and online services too like Outlook, Skype, Office and SkyDrive.

(*) The only exception to all of this is my Synology NAS drive which I'll hold dear to my heart with how perfect and irreplaceable it is.

It's not like I'm unfamiliar with Microsoft  products, I've only been using Windows and Office products since I've ever touched a computer. I'm more interested in a fully integrated no-nonsense setup.

No-nonsense being the keyword. I'm completely comfortable with DIY. One time I created a scheduled task to download content upon availability, then  transcribe the content to a number of different media types which were then moved to a few different directories making them available to be accessed both online via phone and tablet and offline via PS3. Finally I'd be notified by email when the task completed.

But in the end, that shit's annoying.

I want to be able to view and modify documents on my PC, tablet and phone with zero hassle. I want to stream media and share contacts/calendars between all of my devices and family members with extensive permissions. I want lag free, simple UI devices.

Maybe this is a terrible idea. I do enjoy my android phone and PS3 after all. I've customized them heavily enough to do everything I care for, I just think that if there's a chance that the above can be achieved by using all of one suite of products without custom apps or special setups, I'm sold.
