I love understanding how things work, why things stop working and what it takes to get them fixed. Not only that, but I'm always interested in knowing the best way to accomplish the task (think efficient use of action points in videos games). Basically, if time permitted I'd be able to hack at anything and be awesome. Unfortunately there's not enough time to learn it all and I don't think it's worth the effort to be inadequate at a bunch of things.

One of the best things I learned in college was to get really really great at one or two things. I mean, get really good. But the trick is, it's got to be something you enjoy. Become the expert at this among your peers and put yourself up against strangers. Network with others outside of your circle to learn new ways to get even better. Become so damn good that there's a word association of that thing to your name. Have people you haven't talked to in ages on Facebook or random people on LinkedIn privately message you for advice about your expertise.

The neat part is, if this is something you love doing, there's going to be perpetual encouragement from both yourself and others to keep at it. Chances are there is always someone better than you. If you're challenge driven at all, it's really rewarding to becoming better and better at your skill.
