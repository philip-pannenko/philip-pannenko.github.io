Slightly motivated by this post by The Oatmeal: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running

I'm less than a week out from my Ironman distance triathlon and as I start replaying in my mind the training that's lead me here, I realize it's been an incredible last four months. In the past four months, I now work at a new company, our kitchen remodeling is done, we added a puppy to our family, another semester of grad classes are over and we'we had numerous great week night and weekend adventures.

Amidst all of that chaos there was time to train.

Now, the odd part that I find trouble explaining is, if it weren't for the training, I feel like I'd be overwhelmed by all of the recent happenings. I'd fret over each incomplete task, worry about what others think or what to do and stress out when I'd try to sit back and relax.

There's one incredible thing about training and that it's all about you. You challenge yourself. You set your own goals. You pave the path for your own accomplishments.

There's another incredible thing about being up in the early morning and that it's your time. Nobody is going to bother you. Nothing is going to distract you. You can focus 100% on whatever it is you want to do.

These past few months, each morning I'd wake up and hit the road running, get in a few laps at the pool or crank away on my indoor bike while watching Netflix. I owe it to the training that has gotten me through the last few months. It may not work for everyone, and it may sound like a big sack of crap, but if you've never tried it, I'm certain there's some value behind it.
