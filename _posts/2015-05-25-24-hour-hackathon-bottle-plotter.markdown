Buddy of mine and I stocked up on some caffeine and coded for 24 hours straight. The [result](https://anotherlizwong.github.com/bottlplottr) wasn't too bad.

Basically, the purpose was to make a tool that would assist with planning for the amount of bottle caps needed to make a design for a table of a specified size. Given that this was our first ever hackathon, we were pretty impressed by logistics and results. 10 out of 10, would do again.
