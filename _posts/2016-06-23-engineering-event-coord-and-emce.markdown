By this point in time I have comfortably gotten past 10,000 hours of software development, thanks [Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)) for identifying that number for us. What I have definitely not gotten 10,000 hours in, let alone 100, is public speaking or event coordination. That doesn't stop me from making a fool of myself though. Just a few weeks ago I coordinated, budgeted, recuited volunteers, emceed and for an event at a company I work at. Thanks to a little bit of multi threaded tasking _*cough* deligation *cough*_, I even had a chance to participate myself in the event. It wasn't a complete trainwreck and people actually had fun. Bonus.

Here's some national, front page news on the [matter](http://tech.dealer.com/nationwide-spring-engineering-event/).
