Just recently I read a good article about IDEs and how that they are only as good as you know how to use them. Really agree with that point. Found some additional ways to make Eclipse even better. Minor plugins that make tasks even easier and more pleasant to use. 

* Findbug 
	* (http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/findbugs-eclipse-plugin)
	* One of the many static analysis tools that are necessary
* Glance Search Engine 
	* (http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/glance)
	* A significantly less stressful and more useful 'find' functionality
* Toad DB Plugin 
	* (http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/toad-extension-eclipse)
	* More control of DB connections than the default included database explorer. Slight pain to setup
* Checkstyle plugin 
	* (http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/checkstyle-plug)
	* A more thorough validator and formatter.
* Dynamic Maven Debug Linker 
	* (http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-dynamic-sources-lookup)
	* One of the only important plugins of the bunch. Without this one, code doesn't link too well in Eclipse when using Maven? With this plugin code gets linked properly.
* StartExplore 
	* (http://marketplace.eclipse.org/node/641101)
	* Convenient way to navigate to a directory from a context menu selection from the IDE.

Something that I'm still trying to find out how to do in Eclipse is, forcing the IDE to format a file in whichever format I'd like. Notepad++ has this feature by just selecting the Language menu bar. For the life of me I can't figure this out in Eclipse.
