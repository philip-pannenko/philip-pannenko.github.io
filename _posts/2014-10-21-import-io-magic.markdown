Recently I needed to write a coffee themed shopping cart app for a class assignment. I needed a good amount of varying data to help populate the screens. What I started doing was just scrapping data off of screens manually but it occurred to me there must be programs already that do this. Enter stage left, [Import.IO][1].

Import.IO is a data scraping software that is easy to use and nasty at how effective it is. I quickly picked up their API (because it was easy to follow) and slapped together something that scraped some data based off of my built template. I clicked the go button on the scrapping script and went to lunch. When I got back I had hundreds of entries in the data format that I had built. Very thorough and very easy.

Looking forward to actually using this in the future. Maybe I can scrape some football stats during the next season and kick some ass at my work pool.
