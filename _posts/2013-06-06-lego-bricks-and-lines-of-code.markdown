I think I enjoy software development because of its immediate gratification and its almost infinite possible levels of achievements.

Java:
{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}
C++:
{% highlight c++ %}
cout << "Hello World!";
{% endhighlight %}
Bam, rewarding. Something prints to screen. It's simple, but rewarding. After the first go around, maybe not so much rewarding anymore. Nonetheless, a staple sequence to be done when learning any new feature/language/etc...

To me, LEGO bricks provide practically the same gratification. Grab any kit, put a few brinks together and you've got something. It may not be  the neatest looking thing, but it's something that you created and can be interacted with. As you see more brick combinations (and acquire more kits) you build neater creations.

As abilities increase, reward standards increase as well. Tasks bring fewer satisfaction so naturally we try new things. Something that I've noticed with myself is that I am constantly immersed with some sort of coding, whether it's a hobby project, a master's degree assignment or some task for work. I don't know why I do this.
