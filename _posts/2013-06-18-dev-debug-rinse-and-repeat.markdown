There are very few things that irk me when it comes to development. I can adjust to different code conventions. I can learn new languages. I can even yield to using older libraries and frameworks due to client validation and security concerns. (I will never miss making sure my code works for IE6 though!)

But what I cannot bear to stand is long development/debugging cycles. What I mean by this is the length of time it takes to see a code change on screen.

Now, before sounding like too much of a hypocrite, I understand there's the difference between a compiled language vs a run-time language. I'll admit that I don't mind a little bit of the extra tax from using a compiled language. But what that does not mean is that the tax should be anywhere greater than 30 seconds let alone minutes.

When development cycles go longer than 30 seconds it's difficult to focus and to try new things. Sometimes during those times were I'm stuck waiting to see a change on screen, I hear this chilling sound of a punch card being operated in the near distance.
