Buddy of mine and I stocked up on some caffeine *again* and coded *again* for 24 hours straight. The [result](http://anotherlizwong.github.io/burger-bop/) wasn't too bad.

At the time our favorite bar introduced build your own burger. So naturally, we tried to make a game of what ingredients we could put on there to make it random. From there spawned the idea to slot machine ingredients onto burgers.
